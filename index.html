    <h1>KFC Restaurant Closing at Irving TX</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>- <strong>Strategic Location Advantage</strong>: Pollo Campero's close proximity to the closing KFC, along with its high food quality and service ratings, positions it well to attract displaced KFC customers. Its superior ratings in food quality (4.76) and service (4.63) compared to nearby competitors like El Ranchero and Church's Chicken can be leveraged to draw in new patrons.</p>
        <p>- <strong>Drive-Thru and Delivery Focus</strong>: Given the high reliance on drive-thru sales (49.31%) at the Irving location, Pollo Campero should capitalize on this by ensuring efficient and appealing drive-thru operations to attract former KFC customers who prefer this convenience. Additionally, the higher-than-average delivery sales (1.58%) present an opportunity to further invest in and promote delivery services to capture customers seeking home delivery options.</p>
        <p>- <strong>Addressing Service and Menu Issues</strong>: To maximize the opportunity, Pollo Campero should address specific service complaints and improve the taste of its grilled chicken. By enhancing these areas, Pollo Campero can strengthen its overall customer satisfaction and better compete with other nearby options, ensuring it becomes the preferred choice for former KFC customers.</p>

        <h2>Geographic Overview</h2>
        <p>- The competitors are positioned within a close proximity to the KFC that is closing down, with Pollo Campero (green dot) and El Ranchero (blue dot) being the nearest, located just north of the KFC on the same street. This close positioning makes them well-placed to attract customers who previously frequented KFC.</p>
        <p>- Church's Chicken (blue dot) and Mr. Wong's Chicken & Rice (blue dot) are also within the 1-mile radius but are located further south and east respectively. While they are not as close as Pollo Campero and El Ranchero, they still have the potential to attract some of the displaced KFC customers due to their similar offerings and relatively close distance.</p>

        <p>- <strong>Drive Thru Dominance:</strong> The Irving location has a significantly higher share of sales from the Drive Thru channel (49.31%) compared to all US locations (21.11%). This suggests that the Irving location is highly reliant on customers arriving by car, making it crucial to maintain efficient and appealing drive-thru operations to sustain and grow this customer base.</p>

This indicates that the Irving location may need to enhance its in-store dining experience and promote its takeout options to attract more foot traffic and customers who prefer to eat at home.</p>
        <p>- <strong>Opportunity in Delivery:</strong> The Irving location has a higher share of sales from Delivery (1.58%) compared to the national average (0.07%).
